# Gym Automata
---

_Gym Automata_ is a collection of _Reinforcement Learning Environments_ (RLEs) that follow the [OpenAI Gym API](https://gym.openai.com/docs).

The available RLEs are based on [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) (CAs). On them an _Agent_ interacts with a CA, by changing its cell states, in a attempt to drive the emergent properties of its grid to a desired configuration.
